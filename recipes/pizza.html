      leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various
      other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives,
      pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature,
      traditionally in a wood-fired oven.A small pizza is sometimes called a

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start with a medium bowl that's been lightly coated with olive oil. Add
        warm water (about 110 degrees F), dry yeast and sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the bowl containing the flour and salt, make a well in the center and
        add the yeast. Tip: If the yeast doesn't foam, check the expiration date
        and water temperature (should be approximately 110 degrees F). Add the
        olive oil. Use a fork to pull the dry into the wet, then mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the dough starts to come together, get in there with your hands and
        knead it for a few minutes on a lightly floured board. Use the heel of
        your hand to push the dough down and forward. Give it a few turns.
        You're done when the dough is a little tacky.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the kneaded dough into the oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and
        let it rise in a warm spot until it doubles in size. Tip: Chart the
        progress of the rising dough by using a marker on the plastic wrap to
        circle the size of the ball of dough at the beginning of the process. It
        can take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours for the dough to rise, depending on
        the recipe and ambient temperature.
